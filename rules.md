### ðŸ“• `1.` **No harassment or personal attacks.** 
No name-calling, and no disrespect towards others. Do not attempt to create drama. It's not okay to make fun of someone (whether to their face nor behind their back). If you have an issue with someone, just block them and ignore them. If the person is creating issues for other members too, please let a moderator know.

### ðŸ“• `2.` **No NSFW or suggestive content.**
And nothing even close. We have many younger users on the server, and we want to keep things as safe as possible at all times. This applies to everything, including (but not limited to): images posted in the chat (either by upload or hyperlink), images in user profiles, videos posted or uploaded to chat, bot commands used, text or image topics (Yes, topics. You can't talk about nsfw topics.), usernames, nicknames, "playing" statuses, etc. If it is nsfw, lewd, or even suggestive, it is not welcome on the server.

### ðŸ“• `3.` **No spamming, copypastas, bandwagoning, memes, mass-pings, etc.** 
This includes many categories: Excessive amounts of messages or images constitutes spam. Overuse of capitalization or formatting (making your messages stand out), when done repeatedly or in large amounts is spam. Pinging users repeatedly, without context, or pinging many users at the same time. Using bot commands, especially after other commands have already been used (in channels other than the designated bot channel). Adding multiple reactions to the same message. Sending messages that are mostly or full of emoji/emotes. Copypastas or memes of almost any type. Annoying ("unicode") nicknames. Bandwagoning (chains of messages, emotes, or actions done by one or more users). Attempting to mass-ping.

### ðŸ“• `4.` **Respect other hunting parties.**
If a group is utilizing one of the voice chats for their hunt, please ask them before joining or chatting. It is very distracting to be chatting with members of your hunting party, and suddenly being interrupted by people who are not in your in-game hall. If a group has not stated they are looking for more hunters, please don't assume they are.

### ðŸ“• `5.` **Stay on-topic.** 
Every channel has a topic; please make sure to click the topic (next to the channel name at the top of the screen, or above the user list on mobile) and read it entirely. Some channels have additional rules beyond the server-wide rules. For channels that have a specific topic, those topics are the only topics allowed. For channels that allow multiple topics, users must stay on the topic of the current conversation. Interrupting a conversation with an unrelated remark, image, video, or command is a disruption to the current topic and is not allowed. Keep in mind that some topics are not allowed at all, and must be kept off the server entirely (ex: Politics, Religion, any NSFW topic).

### ðŸ“• `6.` **Do not discuss cheating, hacking, mods, leaked content, piracy, illegal activities, nor any other questionable material. Do not use cheated equipment, accounts, mods, nor unreleased content when hunting here.**
We only allow content here that is intentionally accessible (by Capcom) through official announcements and playing the games in a normal manner.  Do not discuss mods or cheats of any kind. Do not discuss cheating or encourage other users to cheat, and do not attempt to claim that anything obtained from cheating/powersaves is legitimate. When hunting with members of the Monster Hunter Gathering Hall, it should be safe to assume that your fellow hunters are using only gear that they gained via legitimate effort and time (without cheats of any kind).

### ðŸ“• `7.` **No advertising.** 
The server should not be used as a means to reach lots of other users with advertisements for products, services, contests, giveaways, etc. This includes links to other Discord servers, links to youtube channels or twitch streams (except in certain, designated channels), strawpolls (or other voting sites), pay-per-click links (like adfly), and any kind of referral link. In short, if it is any kind of self-promotion, self-earning, or referral, it is not allowed. These same rules also apply to DMs, usernames, nicknames, avatars, images, and "playing" statuses.

### ðŸ“• `8.` **Don't try to find loopholes in the rules.** 
If you even have to ask if something is against the rules, it probably is. Stretching the rules is breaking the rules. Additionally, if a moderator says to cease a particular action, continuing to do it, even at a later time, is breaking the rules.

### ðŸ“• `9.` **Follow Capcom's and Discord's rules.**
A copy of Capcom's rules can be found here: <https://mhgh.info/capcom-rules>  
Discord's Terms of Service can be found here: <https://discordapp.com/terms>

### ðŸ“• `10.` Most importantly: **RESPECT**
Be respectful towards everything and everyone!
