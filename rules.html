                <p class="lead text-center">Here you'll find the rules for the <b>Monster Hunter Gathering Hall</b>, along
                with clarifications and explanations for each. Please respect these rules at all times. If you agree to these
                rules, please follow the instructions in the #rules_and_info channel (within the server).</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- body -->
    <div class="container rules">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>No harassment or personal attacks. Ever.</h3>
          <p>No name-calling, no disrespect. It's not okay to make fun of someone (whether to their face nor behind their
            back). If you have an issue with someone, just block them and ignore them. If the person is creating issues
            for other members too, please let a moderator know.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>No NSFW (Not-Safe-For-Work) Content</h3>
          <p>And nothing even close. We have many younger users on the server, and we want to keep things as safe as safe as
             possible at all times. This applies to everything, including (but not limited to): images posted in the chat (either
             by upload or hyperlink), images in user profiles, videos posted or uploaded to chat, bot commands used, text or image
             topics (Yes, topics. You can't talk about nsfw topics.), usernames, nicknames, "playing" statuses, etc. If it is nsfw,
             lewd, or even suggestive, it is not welcome on the server.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>No spamming</h3>
          <p>This includes many categories. Excessive amounts of messages or images consitutes spam. Abuse or capitalization or
            formatting (making your messages stand out), when done repeatedly or in large amounts is spam. Pinging users repeatedly,
            without context, or pinging many users at the same time. Using bot commands, especially after other commands have already
            been used (in channels other than the designated bot channel). Adding multiple reactions to the same message. Sending
            messages that are mostly or full of emoji/emotes. Copypastas of almost any type. Annoying ("unicode") nicknames.
            Bandwagoning (chains of messages, emotes, or actions done by one or more users).</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Respect Other Hunting Parties</h3>
          <p>If a group is utilizing one of the voice chats for their hunt, please ask them before joining or chatting. It is very
             distracting to be chatting with members of your hunting party, and suddenly being interrupted by people who are not in
             your in-game hall. If a group has not stated they are looking for more hunters, please don't assume they are.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Stay On-Topic</h3>
          <p>Every channel has a topic; please make sure to click the topic (next to the channel name at the top of the screen, or
             above the user list on mobile) and read it entirely. Some channels have additional rules beyond the server-wide rules.
             For channels that have a specific topic, those topics are the only topics allowed. For channels that allow multiple
             topics, users must stay on the topic of the current conversation. Interrupting a conversation with an unrelated remark,
             image, video, or command is a disruption to the current topic and is not allowed. Keep in mind that some topics are not
             allowed at all, and must be kept off the server entirely (ex: Politics, any NSFW topic).</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Cheating is Discouraged</h3>
          <p>Do not discuss cheating or encourage other users to cheat, and do not attempt to claim that anything obtained from
             cheating/powersaves is legitimate. When hunting with members of the Monster Hunter Gathering Hall, it should be safe to
             assume that your fellow hunters are using only gear that they gained legitamately (without cheats of any kind). Some
             customization discussion may be permitted in appropriate channels; see the channel topics for more info.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>No Advertising</h3>
          <p>The server should not be used as a means to reach lots of other users with advertisements for products, services,
             contests, giveaways, etc. This includes links to other Discord servers, links to youtube channels or twitch streams
             (except in certain, designated channels), strawpolls (or other voting sites), pay-per-click links (like adfly), and
             any kind of referral link. In short, if it is any kind of self-promotion, self-earning, or referral, it is not
             allowed. These same rules also apply to DMs, usernames, nicknames, avatars, images, and "playing" statuses. Note:
             the only time that it is acceptable to share a link to one of these services is in a designated channel (ex: #streaming
             for twitch links), or via DMs if (and only if) the other user requests the link.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Don't Try to Find Loopholes in the Rules</h3>
          <p>If you even have to ask if something is against the rules, it probably is. Stretching the rules is breaking the rules.
             Additionally, if a moderator says to cease a particular action, continuing to do it, even at a later time, is breaking
             the rules.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>RESPECT</h3>
          <p></p><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <h2 class="text-center">Unwritten Rules</h2>
                <p class="lead text-center">These are rules that are not shown in the #rules_and_info channel,
                  because they are very specific cases, or they are believed to be common sense. All users are responsible for
                  these rules, just like any other rules.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container rules">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Don't Tell People How to Agree to the Rules</h3>
          <p>The whole point of having the system is to encourage users to read the rules. If you outright tell someone what to
             do (or even give them hints), you are encouraging them not to read (and comprehend) the rules. We don't want people
             skimming the rules, we want them reading them.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Do Not Cheat During Contests</h3>
          <p>This one is pretty obvious. If there is a contest going on, the purpose is to be fun for everyone. The moderators
             will do our best to ensure that no one cheats (and that if someone cheats, they will be punished accordingly), but
             in theory, we shouldn't need to because everyone should be honest and treat the contests as a way to have some fun
             and friendly competition.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Don't Make a Big Deal About Someone Having a White Name</h3>
          <p>If someone has a white name (no roles, aka no "Hunter" role), all it means is that they haven't agreed to the rules
             yet. Our community is open to everyone. Yes, there are certain features that are locked behind reading and agreeing
             to the rules, but it is not a hard requirement to participate or chat in the server. All users are held responsible
             for the rules, regardless of whether or not they have read them. If someone asks how to do an action that is locked
             behind the Hunter role, feel free to point them to #rules_and_info, which describes exactly how one can agree to the
             rules.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>No Ban/Mute Evasion</h3>
          <p>If you are banned or muted, it was for a reason. If you want to appeal the ban or mute, first talk to the moderator
             that banned or muted you privately (in a Direct Message). If you don't share any mutual servers (in the case of a
             ban), you may use the ban appeal form linked at the top of this web page. Do not make a second account to try to
             evade punishment. If you are caught evading a punishment, you will be permanently banned with no chance of appeal.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Let Change Happen</h3>
          <p>Occasionally, things on the server change. Channels may be added or removed, rules may be changed, or systems might
             be reworked. Most changes happen due to dissatisfaction of a large portion of members, or access to new features. If
             a change happens that you don't agree with, consider writing up your concerns and sending to an admin, or sharing in
             #moderator_ama. Creating an outrage does not help in any way, and concerns raised during an outrage will likely be
             ignored. On the other hand, concerns raised in a calm and informative fashion will always be considered.</p><br>
