# Enter the Gathering Hall
Looking for a fun and exciting community of hunters? Whether you're a beginner or veteran, there is something for every Hunter! We have space to talk about every game and weapon in the series, and we are welcoming to everyone!

## <i class="fas fa-calendar-day"></i> Organization
We value keeping chat on-topic and accessable for everyone. We also want to allow users to customize their experience by providing the ability to completely hide some channels that they don't want to see, or join opt-in ones!

## <i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Teamwork
We are always eager to help out our new hunters! Whether you want to rank up, have some questions about an armor set, need to do a few quick egg runs, or just want to know which weapon is best for you, we're happy to help!

## <i class="fas fa-laugh"></i> Fun
We hold events and contests, and reach out to other communities to make the server more fun for everyone! We also have plenty of ways to find other hunters and hunt together, or just chat about the various games!

## <i class="fas fa-infinity"></i> Partnership
The Monster Hunter Gathering Hall has been officially recognized and partnered with Discord! This grants us higher-quality voice chat and early access to some features! This also provides our custom /monsterhunter invite link!
